# Federated Multi-armed Bandits with Personalization

This is the supplementary code for the AISTATS 2021 proceeding "Federated Multi-armed Bandits with Personalization". The details of codes are specified as following and the results can be get by directly running the notebook "PF-UCB.ipynb". The obtained data will be stored in folders: scores, scores_improved, and socres_movielens.

## Requirement

- Python 3.7
- numpy 1.18.1
- matplotlib 3.1.3

## Code Description

The PF-UCB algorithm is implemented in files "bandits.py", "client.py" and "server.py". The enhanced version is implemented in files "bandits_improved.py", "client_improved.py" and "server_improved.py".

## Dataset Description

The synthetic dataset used in Fig. (1) is contained in the notebook. The original MovieLens dataset can be downloaded from [here(https://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/)] and the preprocessing steps are specified in the paper. The processed MovieLens dataset is contained in the file "movielens_norm_10_40.npy". The synthetic dataset used in Fig. (4) is contained in file "means.npy".

## How to use

The current project environemnt is based on Poetry. After cloning this repository run the next commands in the cloned root folder for getting up and running your project _Jupyter Notebook_:

```bash
poetry install
poetry run jupyter notebook
```

Then, a web browser should pop-up with the project's _Jupyter Notebook_, where you could run cells sequentially by pressing Ctrl+Enter.
